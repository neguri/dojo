'''
URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)

"Mr John Smith   " 13
"Mr%20John%20Smith"
